#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software Engineering is basically the practice of designing and building computer programs and applications in a structured format.
  This involves planning,testing to ensure that it's working correctly and also maintenance. This is important in technology industry because it aids 
  that software is reliable, efficient and meet needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  *Publication of structured programming; This gave rise to principles for organizing codes more effectively like clear control and avoiding spaghetti code thereby improving readability
  *Creation of languages like FORTRAN( 1957); This language made it easier to write computer programs steping away from machine codes which was more complexand error prone.
  *Agile Methodology: Agile methodology emphasized flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback. this shift from rigid waterfall like processes to iterative and incremental     
   development improved how software is built and adapted to changing requiremnet.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  *Design: This invloves identifying, structuring and defining the problems 
  *Developing:Coming out with a solution and testing if it works 
  *Roll out: This invloves the deployment of your solution, your software is released to the prodution environment where it is to be used.
  *Maintenance and Support: This aims to address issues and make neccessary adjustments and update, this is aswell the platform at which unnecessary features are removed and replace with   better ones.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  *Waterfall: It's in sequence. Each phase must be completed before the next begins. it's process reqires design,implementation, testing, deployment and maintenace. it less flexible and  
   as such extensive documentation is produced at each stage. scenarios would be Developng  government software systemwith strict regulations and fixed requiremnets were changes are     
   minimal.

  *Agile: Iterative and incremental. workdone is smaller, manageable units with regular feedback and adjustment. It's process requires Design, implementation, Testing, Deployment and 
   maintenance. chages can be incorporated acrross the project more easily and emphasis is on working software and user feedback and also with frequent updates being possible examples 
   could be developing a mobile app where market conditions may change often as possible.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  *Software Engineer: Disgns softwares, write codes, conducts testing and fixing software problems.
  *Quality Assurance Engineering:They test, create test plans,report problems, and improve processes ensuring that the final product is relible and meet requiremnt before rolling out.
  *Project: A project manager makes plan and coordinate, communicate and generality ensure a good working process and environment.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  *Integrated Development Environment (IDES) provides tools and needed faetures in a place. This could invlove coded editiors, debugging tools etc making work easier and faster. Example     is Visual Studio Code
  *Version Control Systems (VCS) Allows multiple developers to collaborate, revert to previous version etc Example is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  *Debugging: This is one major problem and AI like chatGPT has been Proven to solve this to a large extent 
  *Keeping up with Technology changes: Technology is rapidly changing and one may be left behind if he lacks awareness and one solution to this is to join a current community and to keep   up learning the right things
  *Deadline management: communicate effective with stakeholders and keep to reasonable plans in handling projects, also negotiate a convenient time to finish up with projects.
  *Managing Complexity: Software systems can be really complex which makes them difficult to understand and maintained as such one should use a modular design and architecture pattern to   break down system into smaller and more manageable components.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  *UNit testing: it's a single function method which involves testing individual components components or functions of a software application 
  importance;Early detection of bugs, improves code quality and documentation.
  *Integration: Individual components are combine and tested 
  importance:Improves reliability, confirms intergration and verify combined funtionality.
  *Systems: This is where the entire software is been tested.
  Importance: Validtes overall fuctionality and ensure compliances 
  *Acceptance: This is conducted to ensure that software meets requirements and ready to be deployed 
  Importance: Validtes requirement, confirms usability and provides final approval.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering



Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt Enginnering is about crafting instruction in a format that helps deliver the best response from your robot or AI assistance.
  It's important because it improves accuracy a well strucutred prompt could give an amazing, direct and a more relatable answer which makes it an enhancement to usability and optimize     perfomance.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague: How do i fix my pc keyboard
  Improved: Give me a simple and short step by step guide on how to fix my pc keyboard.
